# GraphQL with ksqlDB in C# Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate **GraphQL** and **ksqlDB** into a C# web API application to build real-time data-driven applications.
It provides a solid foundation for developers looking to leverage the power of `GraphQL` and `ksqlDB` in their projects.

`GraphQL` subscriptions allow clients to receive real-time updates from the server when certain events occur, while `ksqlDB` is a streaming SQL engine for **Apache Kafka**, providing real-time data processing capabilities.

`GraphQL` serves as an abstraction layer that hides the underlying data sources, such as `ksqlDB`, from clients.
This means that clients interacting with a `GraphQL` API are shielded from the complexities of the underlying data storage systems.
